# MemoryGameJava
The classic memory game where you find different pairs, this time numbers. It is currently played from the console and does not check for illegal choices.  

Bugs:  
- You choose an odd size for the game
- You choose the same card twice in the same turn (The game will finish with 1 pair not found or more if you do it multiple times)
- You choose a previously known pair (same as the last one)
- Choosing a known card but not pair will continue as a normal game without breaking it
